# unhashable type: 'list' that means we cannot have mutable data types like list,set or dictionary as elements of a set
# list inside a set cannot be updated or changed as sets are unordered and unindexed
# elements of a set must be immutable i.e. cannot be changed and hashable i.e. have a fixed hash value during its lifetime
